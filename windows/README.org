# Keyboard configuration
Windows keyboard settings gui allows setting key repeat delay and time to fast enough.

## Caps to Control

Sharpkeys allows modifying caps lock to control easily on registry level. Seems to work by swapping "keysyms" (as on Android) https://www.randyrants.com/category/sharpkeys/.
## "US-FIN" layout:

Zip on this folder has the layout. Was made on British ISO keyboard, modifications can be made to mapping sources in the source-directory.

### How it was created?

For ISO keyboards the a and o keys should give ä and ö when pressed with AltGr modifier (as using alt in Mac key mapping). Needs to be done on higher level with keyboard layout creator 1.4.
