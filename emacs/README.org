Emacs 24 configuration based on [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Emacs Prelude]] using newest stable GUI version.

Install Prelude with =curl -L https://git.io/epre | sh=

Configuration is mostly copy pasted from around the net and there's also a few `home made` commands (find them by [[grep:jasalt][rgrep "jasalt"]]).

- emacs/modes/ directory contains some rare-ish elisp files
