Emacs 24 configuration based on [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Emacs Prelude]] using newest stable GUI version.

1) Install Prelude with =curl -L https://git.io/epre | sh= (check prelude page for updated command)
2) Symlink prelude-modules.el =ln -s ~/dotfiles/emacs/prelude-modules.el ~/.emacs.d/=
3) Symlink init.el =ln -s ~/dotfiles/emacs/init.el ~/.emacs.d/personal/=
4) Startup Emacs, packages are downloaded and editor is ready for work.

Configuration is mostly copy pasted from around the net and there's also a few `home made` commands (find them by [[grep:jasalt][rgrep "jasalt"]]).

- emacs/modes/ directory contains some rare-ish elisp files
