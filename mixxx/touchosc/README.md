mixxx_touchosc_mapping
======================

Mapping to use the TouchOSC Jog-On iPad template to control the Mixxx DJ software

Installation on OSX
-------------------

ln -s `pwd`/Touch* ~/Library/ApplicationSupport/Mixxx/controllers/


TODO
----
Volume, crossfader, pitch control, play, cue, beatsync, playposition, and jog wheel are mapped so far.
I will add more controls when I have time.
